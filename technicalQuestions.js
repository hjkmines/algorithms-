// Q1. What is a potential pitfall with using typeof bar === "object" to determine if bar is an object? How can this pitfall be avoided?
var bar = null;
console.log(typeof bar === "object");  // logs true!
console.log((bar !== null) && (typeof bar === "object"));  // logs false

// Q2.  What will the code below output to the console and why?
(function(){
    var a = b = 3;
})();

console.log("a defined? " + (typeof a !== 'undefined'));
console.log("b defined? " + (typeof b !== 'undefined'));

//solution: 
a defined? false
b defined? true

// Q3. What will the code below output to the console and why?
var myObject = {
    foo: "bar",
    func: function() {
        var self = this;
        console.log("outer func:  this.foo = " + this.foo);
        console.log("outer func:  self.foo = " + self.foo);
        (function() {
            console.log("inner func:  this.foo = " + this.foo);
            console.log("inner func:  self.foo = " + self.foo);
        }());
    }
};
myObject.func();

//solution: 
outer func:  this.foo = bar
outer func:  self.foo = bar
inner func:  this.foo = undefined
inner func:  self.foo = bar

// Q4. What is the significance of, and reason for, wrapping the entire content of a JavaScript source file in a function block?
// This is an increasingly common practice, employed by many popular JavaScript libraries (jQuery, Node.js, etc.). This technique creates a closure around the entire contents of the file which, perhaps most importantly, creates a private namespace and thereby helps avoid potential name clashes between different JavaScript modules and libraries.

// Another feature of this technique is to allow for an easily referenceable (presumably shorter) alias for a global variable. This is often used, for example, in jQuery plugins. jQuery allows you to disable the $ reference to the jQuery namespace, using jQuery.noConflict(). If this has been done, your code can still use $ employing this closure technique, as follows:

(function($) { /* jQuery plugin code referencing $ */ } )(jQuery);

// Q5. What is the significance, and what are the benefits, of including 'use strict' at the beginning of a JavaScript source file?

//Solution: The short and most important answer here is that use strict is a way to voluntarily enforce stricter parsing and error handling on your JavaScript code at runtime. Code errors that would otherwise have been ignored or would have failed silently will now generate errors or throw exceptions. In general, it is a good practice.

// Q6. Consider the two functions below. Will they both return the same thing? Why or why not?

//Solution: 
function foo1()
{
  return {
      bar: "hello"
  };
}

function foo2()
{
  return
  {
      bar: "hello"
  };
}

// Q6. What will the code below output? Explain your answer.
console.log(0.1 + 0.2);
console.log(0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3);

//Solution: 
0.30000000000000004
false
